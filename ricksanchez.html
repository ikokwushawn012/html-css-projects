          <ul>
            <li><b>2013</b> - First appearance in Rick and Morty pilot episode, where Rick drags Morty on a chaotic adventure involving Mega Seeds and interdimensional customs.</li>
<li><b>2013</b> - Coined catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!”, a phrase that quickly became iconic and was later revealed to mean “I am in great pain, please help me.”</li>
<li><b>2014</b> - Revealed origin from Dimension C-137, giving fans their first real glimpse into Rick’s multiversal background and emotional baggage.</li>
<li><b>2015</b> - Attended his first wedding—Birdperson’s—only for it to end in betrayal, bloodshed, and a full-on battle against the Galactic Federation.</li>
<li><b>2017</b> - Turned himself into a pickle to avoid family therapy, leading to the legendary “Pickle Rick” episode and a brutal sewer fight with a Russian exterminator.</li>
<li><b>2018</b> - Took a rare vacation to Atlantis (offscreen), casually mentioning it while brushing off questions about an epic Citadel of Ricks story.</li>
<li><b>2020</b> - Battles the Galactic Federation again, demonstrating his unmatched intellect and ruthlessness in the episode “Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri.”</li>
<li><b>2021</b> - Made an incest baby with Morty’s sister (Summer’s egg and Morty’s sperm), resulting in a massive spacefaring being named “Naruto.”</li>
<li><b>2024</b> - Killed his greatest enemy—himself from another dimension—confronting his darker nature in a twisted act of vengeance and self-awareness.</li>

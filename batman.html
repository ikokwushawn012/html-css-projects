         <header><code>Introduction</code></header>
         <p>Batman is a fictional superhero created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger for DC Comics. He first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. His real name is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist who witnessed his parents' murder as a child. Traumatized, he trains extensively and becomes a masked vigilante to fight crime in Gotham City. </p>
         <p>Unlike many superheroes, Batman has no superpowers—he relies on his intellect, physical skill, detective abilities, and a vast array of gadgets. His iconic look includes a bat-themed costume, and he's often seen as dark, brooding, and morally driven. He’s a founding member of the Justice League and one of the most popular superheroes of all time.</p>
         <p>Batman operates from his secret base, the Batcave, beneath Wayne Manor, and is aided by allies like Alfred Pennyworth (his loyal butler), Robin (his crime-fighting partner), and Commissioner Gordon of the Gotham City Police. His enemies are some of the most iconic villains in comics, including the Joker, Catwoman, Penguin, and Two-Face. Batman is known as the Dark Knight or the World’s Greatest Detective, and his stories often explore themes of justice, fear, and dual identity. Over the decades, Batman has appeared in countless comics, TV shows, films, and video games, becoming a global pop culture icon.</p>

         <header><code>Bruce Wayne</code></header>
         <p>Bruce Wayne is the secret identity of Batman. He's a billionaire, philanthropist, and CEO of Wayne Enterprises, one of the most powerful companies in Gotham City. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, during a mugging. This traumatic event shaped his life and inspired his vow to fight crime and injustice.</p>
         <p>Despite his wealth and public image as a charming playboy, Bruce lives a double life as the Dark Knight. He trained for years in martial arts, science, and detective work to become the ultimate crime-fighter. While he presents himself as carefree and social in public, privately he is intense, disciplined, and driven by a strong moral code. Bruce is a complex character torn between vengeance and justice, constantly balancing his human vulnerabilities with his mission to protect Gotham.</p>
         <p><b>Some of Bruce's accomplishments include:</b></p>
         <ul class="list1">
           <li>Founded and leads Wayne Enterprises, a global technology and philanthropy powerhouse.</li>
           <li>Trained extensively in martial arts, detective skills, and multiple sciences to become the World’s Greatest Detective.</li>
           <li>Established the Batcave as a high-tech base for crime-fighting operations.</li>
         </ul>

       <section id="bat_&_robin" class="main-section">
         <header><code>Bat & Robin</code></header>
         <p>Batman and Robin are one of the most iconic crime-fighting duos in comic book history. Often referred to as the Dynamic Duo, they combine Batman's intense, strategic approach with Robin’s energy, optimism, and agility. Batman mentors Robin not only in combat and detective work, but also in channeling pain into purpose—something both share through personal loss. While Batman operates from the shadows, Robin often brings a lighter contrast, adding balance to their partnership. Together, they protect Gotham City with precision, teamwork, and unwavering dedication to justice.</p>
         <p>Robin is the superhero identity used by several characters, most notably Dick Grayson, the original and most famous version. A former circus acrobat whose parents were killed during a performance, Dick was adopted by Bruce Wayne and trained to become his sidekick. As Robin, he’s known for his athleticism, acrobatic fighting style, and sharp wit. Over time, Robin evolves into a hero in his own right—eventually becoming Nightwing in later stories. Other characters, like Jason Todd, Tim Drake, and Damian Wayne, have also taken up the Robin mantle, each bringing their own personality and style to the role.</p>

       <section id="batmobile" class="main-section">
         <header><code>Batmobile</code></header>
         <p>The Batmobile is Batman’s signature vehicle, designed for high-speed chases, durability, and advanced crime-fighting capabilities. It’s equipped with cutting-edge technology, including armor plating, stealth mode, onboard computers, and various weapons and tools. Over the years, its design has evolved—from sleek and futuristic to heavy and tank-like—depending on Batman’s needs and the era. More than just transportation, the Batmobile is a mobile command center that helps Batman patrol Gotham and respond to threats with speed and power.</p>
         <p><b>The Batmobile comes equipped with:</b></p>
         <ul class="list2">
           <li>Armor plating – bulletproof and explosion-resistant</li>
           <li>Jet engine – for rapid acceleration</li>
           <li>Stealth mode - silent running and radar evasion</li>
           <li>Onboard computer – linked to the Batcave</li>
           <li>GPS and tracking systems – real-time navigation and surveillance</li>
           <li>Weapons – missiles, machine guns, EMPs, smoke screens</li>
           <li>Grappling hook – for sharp turns and scaling</li>
           <li>Ejection seats – emergency escape</li>
           <li>Tire-shredders – for disabling enemy vehicles</li>
           <li>Self-driving mode – remote control or autopilot</li>
           <li>Advanced sensors – thermal, night vision, motion detection</li>

         <header><code>Alfred</code></header>
         <p>Alfred Pennyworth is Bruce Wayne’s loyal butler, caretaker, and one of his most trusted allies. A former British intelligence officer and skilled medic, Alfred took on the role of guardian after the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne, raising Bruce and supporting him emotionally and practically throughout his life. He manages Wayne Manor, maintains the Batcave, and often provides medical aid, strategic advice, and even occasional field assistance. Known for his dry wit, wisdom, and unwavering loyalty, Alfred serves as Batman’s moral compass and surrogate father figure, often grounding Bruce when his mission becomes overwhelming.</p>
         <p>In addition to his duties at Wayne Manor, Alfred plays a crucial behind-the-scenes role in Batman's operations—repairing suits and tech, monitoring missions, and covering for Bruce’s absences in public life. Despite his refined demeanor, Alfred is highly capable under pressure, with a background in combat, espionage, and first aid. He often challenges Bruce's more extreme decisions, reminding him of his humanity and the importance of balance. Alfred’s quiet strength, intelligence, and deep compassion make him an irreplaceable part of Batman’s world—not just as support, but as family.

         <header>Dick Greyson</header>
         <p>First raised in a traveling circus, Dick Grayson lost his acrobat parents to a mobster’s sabotage, a tragedy Bruce Wayne recognized all too well. Bruce adopted him, and the pair created the first Dynamic Duo. As Robin, Dick balanced dazzling athleticism with a quick sense of humor, lightening Batman’s darker edge while learning detective work, martial arts, and leadership.</p>
         <p>In time Dick realized he needed an identity of his own. Leaving Gotham for Blüdhaven, he became Nightwing, showing he could protect a city without Bruce’s shadow. He led the Teen Titans, joined the Justice League, and even filled in as Batman when Bruce was missing. Through it all, Dick remains the heart of the Bat‑Family, trusted by heroes across the DC universe.

       <section id="romance" class="main-section">
         <header>Romance</header>
         <p>Batman’s romantic life is as complex and conflicted as his crusade against crime. Over the years, he has formed deep yet often doomed relationships with several women, most notably Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman. Their bond is defined by tension, trust issues, and a mutual understanding of living double lives. Despite being on opposite sides of the law, their chemistry is undeniable. At times, they've fought side by side or shared quiet rooftop moments, even nearly getting married in modern comics—only for it to fall apart due to Bruce's belief that happiness might dull his effectiveness as Batman.</p>
         <p>Beyond Catwoman, Bruce Wayne has had significant romances with characters like Talia al Ghul, daughter of Ra’s al Ghul and mother of his biological son, Damian Wayne. That relationship was fueled by passion and danger, often pulling Bruce into morally gray territory. He’s also had connections with characters like Vicki Vale, Julie Madison, and Silver St. Cloud, who fell for Bruce but struggled with the weight of his double identity. Bruce’s emotional walls, deep trauma, and obsession with protecting Gotham often sabotage his chance at lasting love, leaving him lonely despite the many women who’ve cared for him.</p>

       <section id="tim_drake" class="main-section">
         <header>Tim Drake</header>
         <p>Unlike his predecessors, Tim Drake discovered Bruce and Dick’s secret identities by observing their moves and matching acrobatics. Convinced Batman needed a partner after Jason’s death, Tim persuaded Bruce that Robin stood for hope, not just sidekicking. As the third Robin he emphasized brains over brawn, bringing expert hacking skills, strategic planning, and compassionate leadership to the role.</p>
         <p>Tim eventually took the independent name Red Robin, founded the Young Justice team, and led the Teen Titans. He has investigated multiverse threats, reverse‑engineered alien tech, and even kept Wayne Enterprises afloat during crises. Tim’s detective mind often rivals Bruce’s, and his optimism helps hold the Bat‑Family together when darkness looms.</p>

       <section id="villains" class="main-section">
         <header>Villains</header>
         <p>Batman’s villains are some of the most iconic and psychologically complex in all of fiction, often reflecting different aspects of his own identity and trauma. Chief among them is the Joker, a chaotic, unpredictable clown who thrives on anarchy and challenges Batman’s moral code. Other major foes include Two-Face, once Bruce’s friend Harvey Dent, whose descent into madness represents duality and loss; The Riddler, who obsesses over proving his intellect; and Scarecrow, who uses fear as a weapon, much like Batman himself. Characters like Penguin, Bane, Poison Ivy, and Mr. Freeze bring physical, intellectual, and emotional threats to Gotham, each with tragic backstories or twisted goals. Together, these villains form a rogues’ gallery that not only tests Batman’s strength and strategy, but also constantly pushes him to confront his own darkness.</p>
       </section>
       <section id="jason_todd" class="main-section">
         <header>Jason Todd</header>
         <p>Jason was a Gotham street kid who tried stealing the Batmobile’s tires, catching Batman’s attention. Bruce saw potential and offered him the Robin mantle, hoping discipline would tame Jason’s anger. As the second Robin he fought crime fiercely, but his reckless streak often clashed with Batman’s rules.</p>
         <p>The Joker captured and killed Jason in the famous Death in the Family storyline, scarring Batman with guilt. Years later Jason was resurrected and returned as the Red Hood, wielding guns and lethal force against criminals. Though he still cares for Bruce and the Bat‑Family, Jason believes fear and finality are the only ways to change Gotham, making him an uneasy ally and constant reminder of Batman’s greatest failure.</p>
       </section>
       <section id="joker" class="main-section">
         <header>Joker</header>
         <p>The Joker is Batman’s most infamous and dangerous enemy, a psychotic mastermind who embodies chaos, unpredictability, and moral decay. With his bleached skin, green hair, and maniacal grin, he sees life as a cruel joke and thrives on creating suffering, especially for Batman. Unlike most villains who seek power or wealth, the Joker’s only goal is to break others—mentally and emotionally—just to prove that anyone can descend into madness. He’s responsible for some of the darkest moments in Batman’s life, including the murder of Jason Todd and the paralysis of Barbara Gordon. Their rivalry is deeply personal, with the Joker viewing Batman as the only person who truly “gets” him, while Batman struggles to uphold his no-kill rule against someone who seemingly deserves it most.</p>
         <p><b>Some of Joker's worst atrocities include:</b></p>
         <ul>
           <li>Killed Jason Todd (Robin) with a crowbar and an explosion.</li>
           <li>Paralyzed Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) in The Killing Joke.</li>
           <li>Murdered Sarah Essen, Commissioner Gordon’s wife.</li>
           <li>Poisoned Gotham’s water supply, causing mass chaos.</li>
           <li>Stole Bruce Wayne’s fortune in the Joker War.</li>
           <li>Tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and nuking Metropolis (Injustice timeline).</li>

         <header>Selina</header>
         <p>Catwoman, also known as Selina Kyle, is one of Batman’s most enduring and complex love interests and adversaries. A skilled thief and master of stealth, she walks the line between villain and antihero, often stealing from the corrupt or wealthy but showing compassion for the vulnerable. Her relationship with Batman is defined by flirtation, tension, and mutual respect, with both understanding the dual lives they lead. Though they’ve clashed over the law, Selina has also fought alongside Batman, proving she’s more than just a thief. Over time, her character has evolved from a playful burglar to a layered, morally gray figure who challenges Batman emotionally and philosophically, often making him question his strict sense of justice.</p>

       <section id="legacy" class="main-section">
         <header>Legacy</header>
         <p>Batman’s legacy goes far beyond the dark streets of Gotham—he has become a symbol of resilience, justice, and the power of human will. Through countless stories, mediums, and generations, Batman inspires people to stand against chaos and fight for what’s right, even when hope seems lost. His journey from trauma to heroism shows that ordinary people can rise above their fears and make a difference. The Bat‑Family, his many allies, and the endless challenges he faces ensure that Batman’s mission will continue, reminding us all that true strength comes not from power, but from the courage to never give up.</p>
